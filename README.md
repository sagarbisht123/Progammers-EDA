# Progammers-EDA
An exploratory data analysis on the programmers around the world.
Hello everyone! Sagar here\
In this repository I have made a project on Exploratory Data Analysis on the data collected by Stackoverflow by their survey for the programmers around the world. The attached jupyter notbook contains the trends the insights and the change in market in post-covid terms for programmers. The programmers were asked the questions and with those answers this data analysis has been done. The comparison around the countried, in the age groups has been done to get to know more about programmers.\
The link in the notebook will retrieve a zipped file and will extract it itself. So you need to save it in the system first so that it can be downloaded in the same directory of the project. \
